# MP Configuration Table

The operating system must have access to some information about the multiprocessor configuration. The MP specification provides two methods for passing this information to the operating system: 

- a minimal method for configurations that conform to one of a set of common hardware defaults, 
- and a maximal method that provides the utmost flexibility in hardware design. Figure 4-1 shows the general layout of the MP configuration data structures.


![](/static/images/2501/p038.png)

The following two data structures are used:

1. The MP Floating Pointer Structure. This structure contains a physical address pointer to the MP configuration table and other MP feature information bytes. When present, this structure indicates that the system conforms to the MP specification. This structure must be stored in at least one of the following memory locations, because the operating system searches for the MP floating pointer structure in the order described below: 

a. In the first kilobyte of Extended BIOS Data Area (EBDA), or

b. Within the last kilobyte of system base memory (e.g., 639K-640K for systems with 640 KB of base memory or 511K-512K for systems with 512 KB of base memory) if the EBDA segment is undefined, or

c. In the BIOS ROM address space between 0F0000h and 0FFFFFh.

2. The MP Configuration Table. This table is optional. The table is composed of a base section and an extended section. The base section contains entries that are completely backwards compatible with previous versions of this specification. The extended section contains additional entry types. The MP configuration table contains explicit configuration information about APICs, processors, buses, and interrupts. The table consists of a header, followed by a number of entries of various types. The format and length of each entry depends on its type. When present, this configuration table must be stored either in a non-reported system RAM or within the BIOS read-only memory space. 

An MP configuration table is not required if the system design corresponds to one of the default configurations listed in Chapter 5. Note that these defaults are only for designs that are always equipped with two processors. Systems that support a variable number of installed processors must supply a complete MP configuration table that indicates the correct number of installed processors. For example, systems that ship with only one processor but provide for a later upgrade with a second processor may not use a default MP configuration.


The following is a list of the suggested memory spaces for the MP configuration table:

a. In the first kilobyte of Extended BIOS Data Area (EBDA), or

b. Within the last kilobyte of system base memory if the EBDA segment is undefined, or

c. At the top of system physical memory, or

d. In the BIOS read-only memory space between 0E0000h and 0FFFFFh.

The BIOS reports the base memory size in a two-byte location (40:13h) of the BIOS data area. The base memory size is reported in kilobytes minus 1K, which is used by the EBDA segment or for other purposes.


The exact starting address of the EBDA segment for EISA or MCA systems can be found in a twobyte location (40:0Eh) of the BIOS data area. If system memory is used, the BIOS must not report this memory as part of the available memory space.


These two MP configuration data structures can be located in the ROM space only if the system is not dynamically reconfigurable. The MP configuration information is intended to be read-only to the operating system.


Strings in the configuration tables are coded in ASCII. The first character of the string is stored at the lowest address of the string field. If the string is shorter than its field, the extra character locations are filled with space characters. Strings are not null terminated.

## 4.1 MP Floating Pointer Structure

An MP-compliant system must implement the MP floating pointer structure, which is a variable length data structure in multiples of 16 bytes. Currently, only one 16-byte data structure is defined. It must span a minimum of 16 contiguous bytes, beginning on a 16-byte boundary, and it must be located within the physical address as specified in the previous section. To determine whether the system conforms to the MP specification, the operating system must search for the MP floating pointer structure in the order specified in the previous section. Figure 4-2 shows the format of this structure, and Table 4-1 explains each of the fields. See also Appendix E, for more information.

![](/static/images/2501/p039.png)

```c
struct mp {             // floating pointer
  uchar signature[4];           // "_MP_"
  void *physaddr;               // phys addr of MP config table
  uchar length;                 // 1
  uchar specrev;                // [14]
  uchar checksum;               // all bytes must add up to 0
  uchar type;                   // MP system config type
  uchar imcrp;
  uchar reserved[3];
};
```

![](/static/images/2501/p040.png)

![](/static/images/2501/p041.png)

The MP feature information byte 1 specifies the MP system default configuration type. If nonzero, the system configuration conforms to one of the default configurations. The default configurations, specified in Chapter 5, may only be used to describe systems that always have two processors installed.


Bit 7 of MP feature information byte 2, the IMCR present bit, is used by the operating system to determine whether PIC Mode or Virtual Wire Mode is implemented by the system. 

The physical address pointer field contains the address of the beginning of the MP configuration table. If it is nonzero, the MP configuration table can be accessed at the physical address provided in the pointer structure. This field must be all zeros if the MP configuration table does not exist. 

## 4.2 MP Configuration Table Header

Figure 4-3 shows the format of the header of the MP configuration table, and Table 4-2 explains each of the fields.

![](/static/images/2501/p042.png)

```c
struct mpconf {         // configuration table header
  uchar signature[4];           // "PCMP"
  ushort length;                // total table length
  uchar version;                // [14]
  uchar checksum;               // all bytes must add up to 0
  uchar product[20];            // product id
  uint *oemtable;               // OEM table pointer
  ushort oemlength;             // OEM table length
  ushort entry;                 // entry count
  uint *lapicaddr;              // address of local APIC
  ushort xlength;               // extended table length
  uchar xchecksum;              // extended table checksum
  uchar reserved;
};
```

## 4.3 Base MP Configuration Table Entries

A variable number of variable length entries follow the header of the MP configuration table. The first byte of each entry identifies the entry type. Each entry type has a known, fixed length. The total length of the MP configuration table depends upon the configuration of the system. Software must step through each entry in the base table until it reaches ENTRY COUNT. The entries are sorted on ENTRY TYPE in ascending order. Table 4-3 gives the meaning of each value of ENTRY TYPE.

![](/static/images/2501/p044.png)

### 4.3.1 Processor Entries

Figure 4-4 shows the format of each processor entry, and Table 4-4 defines the fields.

![](/static/images/2501/p045.png)

```c
struct mpproc {         // processor table entry
  uchar type;                   // entry type (0)
  uchar apicid;                 // local APIC id
  uchar version;                // local APIC verison
  uchar flags;                  // CPU flags
    #define MPBOOT 0x02           // This proc is the bootstrap processor.
  uchar signature[4];           // CPU signature
  uint feature;                 // feature flags from CPUID instruction
  uchar reserved[8];
};
```

In systems that use the MP configuration table, the only restriction placed on the assignment of APIC IDs is that they be unique. They do not need to be consecutive. For example, it is possible for only APIC IDs 0, 2, and 4 to be present.

![](/static/images/2501/p046.png)

The configuration table is filled in by the BIOS after it executes a CPU identification procedure on each of the processors in the system. Whenever possible, the complete 32-bit CPU signature should be filled with the values returned by the CPUID instruction. The CPU signature includes but is not limited to, the stepping, model, and family fields. If the processor does not have a CPUID instruction, the BIOS must fill these and future reserved fields with information returned by the processor in the EDX register after a processor reset. See the Pentium Processor Userâ€™s Manual and Intel Processor Identification with the CPUID Instruction (AP-485) for details on the CPUID instruction.

### 4.3.2 Bus Entries

Bus entries identify the kinds of buses in the system. Because there may be more than one bus in a system, each bus is assigned a unique bus ID number by the BIOS. The bus ID number is used by the operating system to associate interrupt lines with specific buses. Figure 4-5 shows the format of a bus entry, and Table 4-7 explains the fields of each entry. 

![](/static/images/2501/p049.png)

![](/static/images/2501/p050.png)

![](/static/images/2501/p051.png)

Each bus in a system must have a unique BUS ID if any one of the following criteria are true:

1. The bus does not share its memory address space with another bus.
2. The bus does not share its I/O address space with another bus.
3. The bus does not share interrupt lines with another bus.
4. Any aspect of the bus as an independent entity is software visible (such as PCI configuration
space).

Special consideration must be given when assigning a BUS ID for local buses such as VL, which are designed to work in conjunction with another bus. If the bus looks like a part of another bus because it uses a subset of that bus's interrupts and address space, rendering it totally invisible to software, it does not need its own bus entry in the table. The two buses are then considered a single logical bus.

### 4.3.3 I/O APIC Entries

The configuration table contains one or more entries for I/O APICs. Figure 4-6 shows the format of each I/O APIC entry, and Table 4-9 explains each field.

![](/static/images/2501/p052.png)

```c
struct mpioapic {       // I/O APIC table entry
  uchar type;                   // entry type (2)
  uchar apicno;                 // I/O APIC id
  uchar version;                // I/O APIC version
  uchar flags;                  // I/O APIC flags
  uint *addr;                  // I/O APIC address
};
```

![](/static/images/2501/p053.png)

### 4.3.4 I/O Interrupt Assignment Entries

These entries indicate which interrupt source is connected to each I/O APIC interrupt input. There is one entry for each I/O APIC interrupt input that is connected. Figure 4-7 shows the format of each entry, and Table 4-10 explains each field. Appendix D provides the semantics for encoding PCI interrupts.

The MP specification enables significantly more interrupt sources than the standard AT architecture by using I/O APICs. When using I/O APICs, it is preferable that the buses do not share interrupts with the other buses. Bus implementations that share interrupts, such as the PCI and VL local buses, support their bus interrupts by overloading them into another bus space. These buses can be supported in one of the following two ways:

1. Interrupt Assignment Entries for each of the bus interrupts are listed in the MP configuration table. Each interrupt destination matches the destination of another interrupt source interrupt that this interrupt shares. For example, if PCI-Device1/INTA# has the same vector as ISA-IRQ2, then both Interrupt Assignment Entries for these vectors would refer to the same destination I/O APIC and INTIN#.
2. No Interrupt Assignment Entries are declared for any of the bus source interrupts, and the operating system uses some other bus-specific knowledge of bus interrupt schemes in order to support the bus. This operating system bus-specific knowledge is beyond the scope of this specification.

### 4.3.5 Local Interrupt Assignment Entries

These configuration table entries tell what interrupt source is connected to each local interrupt input of each local APIC. Figure 4-8 shows the format of each entry, and Table 4-12 explains each field.

## 4.4 Extended MP Configuration Table Entries


A variable number of variable-length entries are located in memory, immediately following entries in the base section of the MP configuration table described in Section 4.3. These entries compose the extended section of the MP configuration table. Each entry in the extended section of the table has three elements:

- ENTRY TYPE
- ENTRY LENGTH
- DATA

ENTRY TYPE and ENTRY LENGTH make up a header that is present in all extended configuration table entries. The ENTRY TYPE and ENTRY LENGTH fields are eight bit unsigned values. ENTRY LENGTH specifies the total length of the given configuration entry. The length of the DATA field is two bytes less than the value specified by ENTRY LENGTH. 

This scheme ensures that operating systems can parse all the entries in the extended MP configuration table area, even if an entry type is unrecognized. Operating systems that find an unknown entry type when parsing this section of the table should ignore the content and move on to the next entry, until the offset from the end of the base table reaches the length that is specified in the EXTENDED TABLE LENGTH field of the configuration table header. The ability to skip entries with unrecognized type codes beyond those listed in Table 4-13 is essential since it is anticipated that more types of entries will be added to this list over time.


The total length of the Extended MP configuration table depends upon the configuration of the system. The entries are sorted on ENTRY TYPE in ascending order. Table 4-13 gives the meaning of each value of ENTRY TYPE. 

![](/static/images/2501/p059.png)

### 4.4.1 System Address Space Mapping Entries

System Address Space Mapping entries define the system addresses that are visible on a particular bus. Each bus defined in the Base Table can have any number of System Address Space Mapping entries included in the Extended Table. Thus, individual buses can be configured to support different address ranges, thereby decreasing the amount of bus traffic on a given bus and increasing the overall system performance. Each consecutive address range that is usable by the operating system to access devices on a given bus has a System Address Space Mapping entry. Figure 4-9 shows the format of each entry, and Table 4-14 explains each field. See also Appendix E, for more information.

![](/static/images/2501/p060.png)

![](/static/images/2501/p061.png)

If any main memory address is mapped to a software visible bus, such as PCI, it must be explicitly declared using a System Address Space Mapping entry.

In the case of a bus that is directly connected to the main system bus, system address space records and compatibility base address modifiers must be provided as needed to fully describe the complete set of addresses that are mapped to that bus. For example, in Figure 4-10, complete explicit descriptions must be provided for PCI BUS 0 and PCI BUS 1 even if one of the buses is programmed for subtractive decode.

![](/static/images/2501/p062.png)

Figure 4-10. Example System with Multiple Bus Types and Bridge Types

Since all device settings must fall within supported System Address Space mapping for a given bus in order to be usable by the operating system, buses that do not support dynamically configurable devices (i.e., ISA, EISA) should support all possible addresses to that bus.


In general, the MP configuration table must provide entries to describe system address space mappings for all I/O buses present in the system. There are two exceptions to this rule:

1. For buses that are connected via PCI-to-PCI-bridge-specification-compliant bridges: in this case, the system address space mappings for such buses may be omitted from the configuration table. In such cases, the operating system is expected to discover the address space mapping by querying the PCI-to-PCI-bridge-specification-compliant bridge directly.

2. For buses that are connected via a parent I/O bus and for which the subtractive decode bit is set (refer to Section 4.4.2 for details).

Typically, this would mean that a minimal description of resources allocated to PCI buses in a system need only include System Address Space Mapping entries for PCI bus zero and any additional peer PCI buses (if present) where these buses are connected by PCI bridges that are specific to the chipset or host bus.

Note

System Address Mappings are unidirectional in nature. They only describe system addresses that propagate to the target bus from any given processor. For DMA support on the target bus, all memory addresses that contain real memory should be accessible directly by either the bus or by a bus-specific DMA controller. For buses with fewer than 32-bit address lines, all real memory at addresses that the bus can generate must be accessible for DMA.

### 4.4.2 Bus Hierarchy Descriptor Entry

If present, Bus Hierarchy Descriptor entries define how I/O buses are connected relative to each other in a system with more than one I/O bus. Bus Hierarchy Descriptors are used to supplement System Address Mapping entries to describe how addresses propagate to particular buses in systems where address decoding cannot be completely described by System Address Space Mapping entries alone. Entries of this type are required for each bus that is connected to the system hierarchically below another I/O bus. For example, given the system described in Figure 4-10, bus hierarchy entries are required for the EISA bus and the PCI BUS 2 since both have parent buses that are themselves I/O buses.


The Bus Hierarchy entry provides information about where in a hierarchical connection scheme a given bus is connected and the type of address decoding performed for that bus. Figure 4-11 shows the format of each entry, and Table 4-15 explains each field. See also Appendix E, for more information.


![](/static/images/2501/p063.png)

![](/static/images/2501/p064.png)

For buses where the BUS INFORMATION:SD bit is set, System Address Mappings may not be needed. Since the bus is defined as being subtractive decode, the range of addresses that appear on the bus can be derived from address decoding information for parent and peer buses.

### 4.4.3 Compatibility Bus Address Space Modifier Entry

The Compatibility Bus Address Space Modifier defines a set of predefined address ranges that should either be added or removed from the supported address map ranges for a given bus. This entry type is used in combination with System Address Space Mapping entries to complete the description of memory and I/O ranges that are visible on a bus that incorporates support for ISA device compatibility.

For example, a host bus bridge for a PCI bus that provides ISA compatibility may decode a predefined range of addresses used for ISA device support in addition to the addresses used for PCI devices on that bus. A Compatibility Bus Address Space Modifier can be used in this case to add these predefined address ranges to the list specified by System Address Space Mapping entries for that PCI bus. As a corollary, in a system where two peer PCI buses are included, one of which provides ISA compatibility, a Compatibility Bus Address Space Modifier can be used to subtract these predefined ranges from the address space assigned to the PCI bus that does not support ISA devices to avoid any potential conflict.


The same effect can be achieved by using System Address Space Mapping entries to completely describe the address ranges supported on a bus, including those ranges that might otherwise be described by a Compatibility Bus Address Space Modifier entry. However, given the number of discrete address ranges that are used for ISA device compatibility, using an approach based solely on System Address Space Mapping entries may result in a significantly larger number of configuration table entries and a corresponding increase in table size. 

Figure 4-12 shows the format of each entry, and Table 4-16 explains each field.

![](/static/images/2501/p065.png)

![](/static/images/2501/p066.png)

PREDEFINED RANGE LIST may take one of the values from Table 4-17. The value of PREDEFINED RANGE LIST indicates the set of address ranges that are to be either added to or subtracted from the address range associated with the BUS ID.

![](/static/images/2501/p067.png)

All addresses in Table 4-17 are in hexadecimal notation. In each case the X represents any hexadecimal digit, 0-F. As a result, the ISA Compatible I/O Range describes 64 distinct ranges.
