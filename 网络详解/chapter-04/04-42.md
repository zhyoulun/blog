# 如何获取帮助和支持

有若干个方法来获取netfilter产品的帮助和支持

## 社区

Netfilter is a FLOSS community. Among other things this means that community support is offered in a best effort approach.

You may direct your help/support request to several support channels, which include:

- The users mailing list: netfilter@vger.kernel.org, archive
- Our documentation (i.e., this wiki, manpages, further documentation, and other resources)
- IRC: #netfilter in libera.chat
- External support tools and forums like stackoverflow, distribution specific channels, and so on
Community support is usually not fully real-time, but the amount of knowledge that it contains is huge :-)

## 企业服务

For some of our users it's important to have a professional paid support service associated with the software they are running. There are a lot of enterprise businesses, vendors, and consulting firms who can provide support related to Netfilter software.

The list below is not exhaustive, and contains no specific meaning, order or association with the Netfilter project, but are well-known in the community.

TODO: create the list

We usually love companies who contribute back to the community :-)
